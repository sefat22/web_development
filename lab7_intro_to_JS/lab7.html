      <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
      <!-- variables in JS are container, where we can save info like numbers, names, decimal, store functions -->
      <!-- How do you declare a variable?
      "let variablename;"
      after the let keyword we give a varibale name or keep it null -->

      <!-- RULES - Extremely case sensitive 
       The varibale names can only be started by 
       1. A letter
       2. An underscore
       3. A dollar sign
       
       NOT ALLOWED
       1. No space 
       2. No keyword-->

       <!-- DATA TYPES
        1. Numeric data - let x = 100
        2. String - A group of characters, letters, words to make sentences, always in quotation mark.
        3. Boolean data - true/false, no quotation mark
        4. null data - emyty variable, kind of like a place holder
        5. undefined data -->
